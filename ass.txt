The ###### or ass is a domesticated equine. It derives from the African wild ass,
Equus africanus, and may be classified either as a subspecies thereof, Equus africanus 
asinus, or as a separate species, Equus asinus.[1]: 1  It was domesticated in Africa 
some 5000–7000 years ago,[1]: 2 [2]: 3715 [3] and has been used mainly as a working animal 
since that time.

There are more than 40 million ######s in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, 
where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. While working ######s are often 
associated with those living at or below subsistence, small numbers of ######s or asses are 
kept for breeding, as pets, and for livestock protection in developed countries.

An adult male ###### is a jack or jackass, an adult female is a jenny or jennet,[4][5][6] and 
an immature ###### of either sex is a foal.[6] Jacks are often mated with female horses (mares) 
to produce mules; the less common hybrid of a male horse (stallion) and jenny is a hinny.
